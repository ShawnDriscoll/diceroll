<h2>In the Beginning<a class="headerlink" href="#in-the-beginning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the first things I do when learning a new language is to
discovery how it generates random numbers. Older computer languages
from the &#8216;70s had their own built-in random number generators. Technically,
they were pseudo-random number generators. But technically, I wanted to
program my Star Trek games anyway no matter what they were called.</p>
<p>In the &#8216;80s, I would discover that not all comptuer languages came
with random number generators built in. Many didn&#8217;t have such a thing
unless some external software library was installed. Both FORTRAN and C
couldn&#8217;t do random anything out of the box. A math library had to be picked from
the many that were out there. And if none were available, a computer class on campus
was available to teach you how to propgram your own random number generator from scratch.</p>
<p>By the &#8216;90s, random number generators were pretty much standardized as
for as how accurately random they were. And they were included in standard
libraries for various languages. By the time Python was being developed, the
C language used to write Python had very robust random number generators.
And because Python was written in C, it just made sense for it to make
use of C libraries.</p>
<p>For those that are curious, <em>diceroll</em> uses the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">random.randint()</span></tt> module that comes
with CPython. There are stronger random generators out there now, with NumPy being one
of them. But at the time of designing <em>diceroll</em>, I didn&#8217;t quite understand how-all
NumPy worked, or what version of it to install. And for rolling dice, the built-in
random number generator would be just fine.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned<a class="headerlink" href="#lessons-learned" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the past, when I needed a random number from 1 to say 6 (see 6-sided dice), I would use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">INT(RND(1)*6)</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">1</span></tt>.
And I would be used to doing it that way for probably 15 years or so, because that is
how most BASIC languages did things. Other languages like C required me to wip out the
80286 System Developer&#8217;s 3-ring binder to find out how <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">srand()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rand()</span></tt> worked,
and under what circumstances.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 20 years, and I&#8217;m learning CPython without knowing the difference between a CPython
or an RPython or any other Python out there. I figured Python was the same all over, even though
I had a feeling Linux did things differently because of its filepath naming and OS commands. And
of course, the first thing I had to try was Python&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">random</span></tt> module, as well as its
ugly-looking <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">randint()</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Right away I noticed the way Python &#8220;loaded&#8221; modules was going to be a learning experience. I
hadn&#8217;t really programmed anything huge since my TANDY Color Computer 3 days running OS-9 Level II
and programming in BASIC09 (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC09">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC09</a>). Python would reveal different
ways of importing modules the more I read about them, and the more code I poured over.</p>
<p>I would soon find that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">random</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">randint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># roll a 6-sided die</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Was the same thing as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">random</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">randint</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">randint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># roll a 6-sided die</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Which looked a bit cleaner. But I was debating if I wanted to use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">randint()</span></tt> at all in
my normal coding.</p>
<p>So while I was learning how to write my own functions, as well as how to go about importing them, I came up with
an idea for <em>diceroll</em>. It would included a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">roll()</span></tt> function, and a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">die_rolls()</span></tt> function as
a &#8220;side effect.&#8221; Even though <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">die_rolls()</span></tt> had no error-checking, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">roll()</span></tt> would call it after
doing its own error-checking.</p>
<p>I was trying to avoid using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">diceroll</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">die_rolls</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">die_rolls</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># roll two 6-sided dice</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For my dice rolls, I wanted something more readable. Something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">diceroll</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">roll</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">roll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;2D6&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># roll two 6-sided dice</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It was almost less typing. And it was easier to spot what kind of roll was being made in my
code. And the simple addition or subtraction of DMs to such a roll was making the function more appealing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">roll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;2D6+3&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># roll two 6-sided dice and add a DM of +3 to it</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
<span class="versionmodified">New in version 2.2.</span></p>
