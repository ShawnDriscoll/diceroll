**diceroll 2.2 Manual**
=======================

**A Python Dice Rolling Module**

https://github.com/ShawnDriscoll/diceroll

Requirements
------------

* **Microsoft Windows**
       *diceroll* has been tested on Windows versions: XP, 7, 8, and 10.
       It has not been tested on MacOS or Linux.
* **Python 2.5**
       *diceroll* was written using the C implementation of Python
       version 2.5.4. Also known as CPython. With some doing, this
       module could of course be re-written for Jython, PyPy, or
       IronPython.

       Eclipse/PyDev, PyCharm, NetBeans, and IDLE all work fine for
       running this module.
        
.. Warning::
   *diceroll* will not work with **Python 2.6+**.
