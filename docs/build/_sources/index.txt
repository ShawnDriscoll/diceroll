**diceroll 2.2 Manual**
=======================

**A dice rolling module**

Requirements
------------

* **Microsoft Windows**
       *diceroll* has been tested on Windows versions: XP, 7, 8, and 10.
       It has not been tested on MacOS or Linux.

       *diceroll* was written using the C implementation of Python

       module could of course be re-written for Jython, PyPy, or
       IronPython.

       Eclypse/PyDev, PyCharm, NetBeans, and IDLE all work fine for
       running this module.
        
.. Warning::
   *diceroll* will not work with **Python 2.6+**.
