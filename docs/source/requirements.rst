**Requirements**
================

* **Microsoft Windows**
       **diceroll** has been tested on Windows versions: XP, 7, 8, and 10.
       It has not been tested on MacOS or Linux.
* **Python 2.5**
       **diceroll** was written using the C implementation of Python
       version 2.5.4. Also known as CPython. With some doing, this
       module could of course be re-written for Jython, PyPy, or
       IronPython.

       Eclipse/PyDev, PyCharm, NetBeans, and IDLE all work fine for
       running this module.
* **Your Game**
       **diceroll** is not a standalone program. It requires your game to make calls
       to it.
       
       Otherwise, no dice.

.. Warning::
   **diceroll 2.2** will not work with **Python 2.6+**.
